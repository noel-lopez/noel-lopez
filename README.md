<h2> Hey there! I'm Noel.</h2>

As a software craftsperson, I am committed to delivering high-quality, maintainable code and continuously improving my skills. I enjoy taking a proactive approach, contributing value and professionalism to every project I am involved in. 👨‍💻

In my free time, I work on open-source projects and I'm active in programming communities, where I like to help out when someone has a question. It's fun and I learn collectively with fellow professionals. 🙌🏻

I'm detail-oriented and creative. I'm good at finding mistakes and solving problems. I believe in following good practices and writing clean code. ✨
